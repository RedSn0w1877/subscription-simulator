# Subscription Simulator

A lightweight Nexus Studio System Simulator. Open `index.html` in a browser to explore the animated starfield UI, sign in with password `test`, and try the subscription tiers, fake checkout, money + NexBucks economy, Nexus Intelligence prompts, creation tools, and unsubscribe/reset flows.

## What's inside
- Multi-theme UI with starfield, animated grid, and a sign-in overlay.
- Tier cards that launch a fake checkout (name, number, expiration, CVV) and grant NexBucks per tier on purchase.
- Separate money and NexBucks balances: money funds subscriptions or converts into NexBucks for tools.
- Generators: adaptive-speed video and image creation with progress bars and colorful shape outputs.
- Tools: drawing pad with color/size controls, music player with simulated progress, and quick Intel prompts.
- Management: add/remove money, convert to NexBucks, unsubscribe, or reset the whole session.
